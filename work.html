   	  The small heart size might reflect the loss of fluid volume.
      Loss of potassium, a crucial body chemical, led to serious medical problems, including abnormal heart rhythm, on Apollo 15, and to a prescription for a potassium‐supplemented diet on Apollo 16. To determine how effective the prescription was and whether the Apollo 16 astronauts lost less potassium than did the Apollo 15 crew, the Apollo 16 astronauts are eating a prescribed amount of potassium in their meals aboard the Ticonderoga. The amount of their dietary intake and their urine and stool output is being measured carefully for a three‐day period just as is done in the care of many patients In community hospitals. Results of these studies and from tests involving injection of a measured amount of harmless radioactive potassium into the astronauts are being compared with those obtained before the flight, Dr. Berry said, “so we can determine what's happening biochemically to their bodies.” By studying potassium and other chemicals and fluids excreted, the doctors hope to solve the mystery of the weight losses.

            <p>"2. UPWARD FLUID SHIFT"</p>
          </blockquote>
         <p> What is the upward fluid shift?
          <br>
          <br>
        Another big change is something called fluid shift.
        Without the force of gravity to pull bodily fluids
        downward, fluids tend to shift upward — toward the
        head. ... “because there is no longer the force of
        gravity pulling the brain down, the brain moves
        upward
        <br>
        <br>
      What causes a fluid shift in space?
      <br>
      <br>
      Upon entry into microgravity, the hydrostatic
      pressure is abruptly removed from the tissues of
      the body, causing a net migration of fluid from the
      legs toward the upper body and head in a cephalic
      fluid shift The investigation tests the hypothesis
      that the normal shift of fluids to the upper body in
      weightlessness contributes to increased
      intracranial pressure and decreased visual capacity
      in astronauts
      This upward shift of bodily fluids has both irritating
      effects and
      more serious consequences on the human body.
      The extra fluid
      in the head blocks the sinuses, causing what is
      known as “space
      sniffles.” Astronauts often have stuffed noses
      throughout their stay
      in space. (White, 1998)
      The upward fluid shift has other more serious
      ramifications: the
      body recognizes the excess fluids in the head and
      face and responds by attempting to eliminate
      bodily fluids. Therefore, blood
      plasma and red blood cell mass are reduced. As a
      result of the
      hemolysis or destroyed red blood cells, astronauts
      often suffer
      from anemia. Anemia is a condition characterized
      as the lack of
      erythrocytes or red blood cells which carry oxygen
      via hemoglobin throughout the body. (De Santo et
      al, 2005)

      <blockquote>
            <p>"3. MUSCLE ATROPHY"</p>
          </blockquote>
        <br>

      Living and working in space is mentally strenuous.
But the absence of gravity makes working in a
spacecraft physically undemanding. On Earth, we
must constantly use certain muscles to support
ourselves against the force of gravity. These muscles,
commonly called antigravity muscles, include the calf
muscles, the quadriceps, and the muscles of the back
and neck. Because astronauts work in a weightless
environment, very little muscle contraction is needed
to support their bodies or move around. Without
regular use and exercise our muscles weaken and
deteriorate. It’s a process called atrophy. Studies have
shown that astronauts experience up to a 20 percent
loss of muscle mass on spaceflights lasting five to 11
days. The loss of muscle mass means a loss of
strength that can be potentially dangerous if an
astronaut must perform a strenuous emergency
procedure upon re-entry into the Earth's gravitational
field. Even though muscle mass and strength can be
regained once astronauts have returned to Earth,
maintaining muscle in space is a concern, especially
for long-duration space missions. The only way to
minimize muscle atrophy in space is through intensive
exercise, particularly strength training exercises,
combined with an adequate diet. Astronauts on the
International Space Station spend 2 1/2 hours per day
exercising to combat the effects of muscle atrophy
 <blockquote>
            <p>"4. BONE LOSS"</p>
          </blockquote>

          Without gravity acting on their bodies, astronauts experience massive loss in
bone density that is similar to the bone loss seen in elderly people with
osteoporosis. Attempts are made to reduce this bone loss through daily
exercise. Astronauts have also shown that taking a small amount of
bisphosphonate, weekly, further reduces bone loss. Pharmaceutical
discoveries like this are already benefiting the Earth’s aging population.
<blockquote>
            <p>"5. RADIATION"</p>
          </blockquote>
          Another major issue faced in space, is radiation and its
effects
on the body. The Earth is protected from excess
radiation by a
natural shield known as the atmosphere. The ozone
layer, which is
found in the stratosphere, absorbs much of the
ultraviolet radiation which emanates from the sun.
There is also a magnetic field
surrounding the Earth which deflects harmful rays.
(Setlow, 2003)
In space, where there is no atmosphere, radiation is
free to travel.
In fact, if an astronaut would stay in space for a year in
a low
orbiting space vehicle such as the ISS, he/she would
receive ten
times the amount of radiation that he/she would have
received on
Earth. And if a solar flare would occur, the radiation
risk would be
enormously multiplied. An event such as this happened
in August
of 1972, releasing in just one day one thousand times
the radiation that we are exposed to in an entire year on
Earth. (White, 1998)
The danger of radiation is that it can cause mutations in
DNA,
genetic material present in every cell of the body. DNA
damage
and mutations are often the first of many steps in the
carcinogenic
process. Therefore, astronauts have an increased risk
for the development of tumors and cancer over their
lifetimes. In addition
to cancer, alterations in the genetic code can cause
infertility and
sterility, birth defects, and stillbirths
